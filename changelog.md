# v4.0.0

- New: logo button in the top right of the pause menu. Opens quick toggles, a button to all settings, and the credits (Developer ziyyhhk, Helper Rafa, Testers Rafa / Broken Team / ziyyhhk). Works on every platform.
- Fixed: the FPS number. It is now measured with the wall clock inside the render hook, so it shows the real frames drawn per second, and it says `(background)` when the throttle is limiting it.
- Fixed: audio staying quiet after tabbing back in. The tab-out volume now scales FMOD's master volume instead of rewriting the game's own volume values, and it re-checks every frame, so a missed focus event can not leave it stuck.
- Fixed: focus detection can no longer report "unfocused" by mistake (two independent checks, two polls in a row), which could throttle the game or dim the audio while you were playing.
- New: Low Latency Mode (Windows / macOS), trims frames queued in the driver so input reaches the screen sooner.
- FPS counter is colored by performance and updates twice a second.

# v3.2.0

- Multi-platform builds, per-platform settings, adaptive particle cap, hotkeys, spike logger.
